# Genetic Maze Solver

This project demonstrates a genetic algorithm that evolves agents to solve procedurally generated mazes, where each agent learns to navigate through the maze using a sequence of moves encoded in their "DNA". The visualization shows 1024 agents simultaneously attempting to solve a 39x39 maze, with successful agents being selected to pass their traits to the next generation. To run this project, you'll need to install Processing IDE from processing.org, then open and run the GeneticMazeSolver.pde file.
